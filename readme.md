## 🧩 Problem Statement

Most logistics and transport teams still run their operations off spreadsheets and paper logbooks. That leads to a familiar set of failures:

- Vehicles double-booked or dispatched while still under repair
- Drivers assigned trips despite expired licenses or suspended status
- Overloaded vehicles because cargo weight is never checked against capacity
- Maintenance that gets forgotten until something breaks
- No real picture of fuel cost, operational cost, or fleet utilization until someone manually compiles a report

**TransitOps** exists to close that gap — one system covering the full lifecycle of a transport operation, from vehicle registration to trip dispatch to cost reporting, with the business rules baked into the platform instead of left to human memory.

## 💡 Our Solution

TransitOps is a role-based web application that gives every stakeholder — from the Fleet Manager to the Financial Analyst — a live, single source of truth for the fleet. The system doesn't just store data; it **enforces the rules that keep operations safe and efficient**: a driver can't be double-booked, an overloaded trip can't be dispatched, a vehicle in the shop can't be sent out, and every status change cascades automatically instead of relying on manual updates.

| 1   | Vehicle registration number must be unique                                               |
| 2   | Retired or In Shop vehicles never appear in dispatch selection                           |
| 3   | Drivers with expired licenses, Suspended, or Off Duty status cannot be assigned to trips |
| 4   | A driver or vehicle already On Trip cannot be assigned to another trip                   |
| 5   | Cargo weight must not exceed the vehicle's max load capacity                             |
| 6   | Dispatch → both vehicle and driver flip to `On Trip`                                     |
| 7   | Complete → both flip back to `Available`                                                 |
| 8   | Cancel (from Dispatched) → both restored to `Available`                                  |
| 9   | Cancel (from Draft) → no side effects, since nothing was ever locked                     |
| 10  | Active maintenance record → vehicle auto-flips to `In Shop`                              |
| 11  | Closing maintenance → vehicle restored to `Available`, unless Retired                    |

## 📊 Demo Walkthrough

1. Register vehicle **Van-05** — max capacity 500 kg, status `Available`
2. Register driver **Alex** with a valid license
3. Create a trip with cargo weight **450 kg**
4. System validates 450 kg ≤ 500 kg → dispatch allowed
5. Vehicle and Driver auto-flip to `On Trip`
6. Complete the trip — enter final odometer and fuel consumed
7. Vehicle and Driver auto-revert to `Available`
8. Create a maintenance record (e.g., Oil Change) — vehicle auto-flips to `In Shop`, disappears from dispatch pool
9. Reports update operational cost and fuel efficiency using the new trip and fuel data

## 📝 Assumptions & Design Decisions

The original problem statement leaves a few details open to interpretation. Here's how we resolved each one, and why:

| Gap in the spec                                                                                                       | Our resolution                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vehicle ROI formula requires "Revenue," which is never defined as a field anywhere**                                | Added a `revenue` field captured at trip creation/completion (rate × distance or a flat fee), rolled up per vehicle for the ROI report                                                             |
| **Dashboard supports a "region" filter, but Vehicle has no region field**                                             | Added a `region` / base-location field to the Vehicle model                                                                                                                                        |
| **Maintenance Log has no defined fields**                                                                             | Modeled it with description, cost, date, and status (`Open`/`Closed`) — cost feeds directly into Operational Cost, status drives the vehicle auto-transition rule                                  |
| **Trip completion requires "final odometer and fuel consumed," but these fields aren't listed under Trip Management** | Added `startOdometer` (snapshotted at dispatch), `endOdometer`, and `fuelConsumed` to Trip; Fuel Efficiency is computed from actual odometer delta, not planned distance, to prevent gamed numbers |
| **Business rules block expired-license/Suspended drivers but don't mention Off Duty**                                 | Off Duty drivers are excluded from the dispatch pool as well — filtered at selection _and_ re-validated at submission                                                                              |
| **No rule defines how a vehicle becomes Retired**                                                                     | Treated as a manual Fleet Manager action, available from any non-`On Trip` status                                                                                                                  |
| **No rule for cancelling a trip still in Draft**                                                                      | No side effects on cancel from Draft, since nothing was locked yet — only Dispatched → Cancelled restores vehicle/driver                                                                           |
| **PDF export listed as both a feature and a bonus item in different sections**                                        | Treated as optional per the explicit rule in the requirements (CSV is mandatory); PDF export listed under Bonus Features                                                                           |
